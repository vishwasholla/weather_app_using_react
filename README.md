# Weather App

This is a weather app that allows users to search for a city and see the current weather conditions. 

### Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies.

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
cd weather-app
npm install
```

### Running the App

To run the app, simply run the following command:

```sh
npm start
```

The app will then be available at http://localhost:3000.

### Code Explanation

The code for this app is located in the `src` directory. The main component is the `App` component, which is located at `src/App.js`. This component is responsible for rendering the search bar and the current weather conditions.

The search bar is implemented using the `react-select-async-paginate` library. This library provides a simple way to create an asynchronous search bar. The search bar is connected to the `onSearchChange` function, which is passed to the `Search` component.

The `onSearchChange` function is responsible for fetching the current weather conditions for the city that the user has selected. The function uses the `fetch` API to make a request to the OpenWeatherMap API. The response from the API is then parsed and passed to the `CurrentWeather` component.

The `CurrentWeather` component is responsible for rendering the current weather conditions for the city that the user has selected. The component uses the data that is passed to it from the `onSearchChange` function to render the weather conditions.

### Deployment

To deploy the app, you can use a service like Heroku or Netlify. Heroku and Netlify both provide a simple way to deploy a React app.

Once you have deployed the app, you can share the URL with your users.

### Conclusion

This weather app is a simple but powerful example of how to use React to create a user interface. The app is easy to use and understand, and it can be easily customized to meet your needs.
